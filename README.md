# Machine-Voice-Recognition

Machine voice recognition, as the word explains, is a software to identify the specific input voice as machine voice or human voice. This is achieved with the help of the comparison of different components of voice. Some of the compared features are MFCC(Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), Formants, Spectral centroid, ZCR(Zero Crossing Rate), Pitch contour, Spectral flatness ect.
These factors are compared within the limited band and explain the features of the voice.
